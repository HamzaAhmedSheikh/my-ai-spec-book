## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Create atomic tasks (15-30 min each) from my Docusaurus book plan.

Include:
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Dependencies between tasks
- Checkpoints after each phase (Setup → Content → Sidebar → Build)

Use Docusaurus docs via context7 to ensure correct implementation steps.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 69 atomic tasks organized into 8 phases following the spec-driven development methodology. Tasks are mapped to user stories (US1-US6) from spec.md and aligned with the implementation plan phases.

**Key Outputs:**

1. **Task Breakdown Structure:**
   - Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks) - Environment validation
   - Phase 2: Foundational (12 tasks) - Docusaurus initialization & configuration
   - Phase 3: Directory Structure (4 tasks) - US4 implementation
   - Phase 4: Content Creation (15 tasks) - US5 implementation with 10 parallel file creation tasks
   - Phase 5: Content Validation (5 tasks) - US6 implementation
   - Phase 6: Sidebar Configuration (5 tasks) - US4 continuation
   - Phase 7: Build & Verification (18 tasks) - US3 production testing
   - Phase 8: Dev Server Test (6 tasks) - US3 development workflow validation

2. **Parallelization Opportunities:**
   - 14 tasks marked with [P] for parallel execution
   - Phase 4 content creation: All 10 file tasks (T022-T031) can run simultaneously
   - Estimated time reduction from 45 minutes sequential to ~5 minutes parallel

3. **Task Format Compliance:**
   - All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
   - Task IDs: T001-T069 (sequential)
   - User Story labels: [US1], [US2], [US3], [US4], [US5], [US6]
   - File paths: Absolute paths from repository root

4. **Dependencies & Critical Path:**
   ```
   Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phases 7-8
   (Setup)   (Found.)  (Dir)     (Content) (Valid)   (Sidebar) (Verify)
   ```

5. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Functional Requirements Coverage: All 17 FRs mapped to specific tasks
   - Success Criteria Coverage: All 12 SCs mapped to verification tasks
   - User Story Coverage: All 6 user stories represented in task phases

6. **Docusaurus Best Practices Integration:**
   - Used Context7 to fetch Docusaurus documentation for:
     - TypeScript sidebar configuration
     - Autogenerated sidebar with `type: 'category'` and `dirName: 'physical-ai'`
     - Frontmatter structure (`title`, `sidebar_label`, `sidebar_position`)
   - Verified correct initialization command: `npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript`

7. **Checkpoints:**
   - After Phase 1: Environment ready
   - After Phase 2: Foundation ready - Docusaurus functional
   - After Phase 3: Content directory structure ready
   - After Phase 4: All content files created
   - After Phase 5: Content formatting validation complete
   - After Phase 6: Sidebar configured
   - After Phase 7: Complete site verified and production-ready
   - After Phase 8: Development workflow validated

**Estimated Execution Time:** 95-120 minutes (1.5-2 hours total)
**Parallel Execution Benefit:** Phase 4 reduced from 30-45 min to ~5 min with 10 workers

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated 69 atomic tasks (15-30 min each) organized by user story with clear dependencies and checkpoints
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests; all validation is manual verification per spec "Out of Scope"
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-docusaurus-setup/tasks.md (complete task breakdown)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to execute tasks, or `/sp.analyze` to validate cross-artifact consistency
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully map all 6 user stories to concrete implementation steps. Critical path identified: Setup → Foundational → Content → Sidebar → Verification. Phase 4 content creation optimized for parallel execution (14 parallelizable tasks total).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task generation completed successfully with proper format validation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: Task count (69 tasks)
  - ✅ PASS: Parallel task count (14 tasks with [P] marker)
  - ✅ PASS: Task format compliance (all tasks follow checklist format)
  - ✅ PASS: User story mapping (all 6 user stories represented)
  - ✅ PASS: Acceptance criteria coverage (all FRs and SCs mapped)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks command with user context for atomic task size (15-30 min) and Docusaurus-specific requirements
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding time estimates per task in future iterations for more granular planning
