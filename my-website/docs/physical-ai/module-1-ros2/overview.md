# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is the backbone of modern robotics development. Just as the nervous system coordinates actions in living beings, ROS 2 coordinates communication between different components of a robotic system.

This module will guide you through:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 - Fundamentals and key concepts
2. **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 Architecture & DDS - Understanding the middleware layer
3. **Chapter 3**: Building Your First ROS 2 Application - Hands-on development
4. **Chapter 4**: Advanced ROS 2 Patterns - Services, actions, parameters, and transforms
5. **Chapter 5**: ROS 2 for Physical AI - Integration with AI frameworks and real robots

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Build and deploy ROS 2 nodes for robot control
- Implement advanced communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Integrate AI models with ROS 2 for physical robot control
- Use ROS 2 Control and Nav2 for autonomous navigation

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

---

## Next Steps

Begin with [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter-1-introduction) to start your journey into ROS 2.
