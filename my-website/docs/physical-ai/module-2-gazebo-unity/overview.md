# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module focuses on physics simulation and environment building. You'll learn to create digital twins of physical robots and environments using Gazebo and Unity.

This module will guide you through:

1. **Chapter 6**: Introduction to Gazebo - Physics simulation fundamentals
2. **Chapter 7**: Building Robot Models - URDF and SDF formats
3. **Chapter 8**: Simulating Sensors - LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
4. **Chapter 9**: Unity for High-Fidelity Rendering - Visual simulation and HRI
5. **Chapter 10**: Integration with ROS 2 - Connecting simulators to ROS 2

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create and simulate robot models in Gazebo
- Build realistic environments for robot testing
- Simulate various sensors and their data
- Use Unity for high-fidelity visual rendering
- Integrate simulators with ROS 2 for seamless development

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with physics simulation (helpful but not required)

---

## Next Steps

Begin with [Chapter 6: Introduction to Gazebo](./chapter-1-introduction) to start building your digital twin.
